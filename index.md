# Theses at the data science (DICE) group

Bachelor's or master's theses at the DICE group typically build on content of our courses or project groups.
We provide a [list of open theses](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/teaching/thesis/) on our teaching website.
In the list, there is a contact person for every thesis.
