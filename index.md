# Theses at the DICE group

Bachelor's or master's theses at the data science (DICE) group typically build on content of our courses or project groups.
We provide a [list of open theses](http://dice.cs.uni-paderborn.de/teaching/thesis/) on our teaching website.
In the list, there is a contact person for every thesis.
The language of your thesis will be English.
You have to contact the respective supervisor by email to make a first appointment.

#### General information about theses in UPB CS

The department of computer science (CS) of the Paderborn University (UPB) provides a list of official rules and regulations as well as a FAQ:

- [CS Academic Rules and Regulations](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/en/studies/formalities/academic-rules-and-regulations/)
- [CS FAQ: Frequently asked questions regarding the computer science program](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/en/studies/advice-and-support/faq/)

Please read the provided information carefully and make yourself familiar with the regulations.



# Starting your thesis

In the regulations mentioned above, it is specified to prepare a work plan.
This will be worked out in consultation with your supervisor.
When you finished your work plan (approximately 4 weeks), you can present it to the professor.

#### Work plan

The work plan has to contain the following elements:

1. description of the task which has to be worked on,
2. motivation of the thesis,
3. explicit formulation of the target setting,
4. description of the tasks that have to be carried out in order to reach the goal,
5. including a related schedule as well as
6. a setting up of a provisional structure of a written elaboration.

You can reuse major parts of the work plan in your thesis.

##### On item 5: Schedule/timetable

The schedule has to contain major milestones.
It is recommended to provide a gantt chart.
Please consider to schedule buffer times.
A template, which as to be adapted, is given by the following list:

- State-of-the-art review
- Proposal of your solution
- Implementation, tests, and benchmarks
- If you chose an iterative approach: Analyze results and go to previous step
- Thesis writing (typically runs in parallel with all other tasks)


##### On item 6: Classical structure of a thesis

A thesis should be structured similar to the following list:

- Introduction
- Related work
- Approach
- Implementation
- Evaluation
- Summary and Discussion

## Template

We recommend to use LaTeX for writing your thesis.
There are various existing templates, e.g. the
